# Mask oss USE flag for PulseAudio; it's present for compatibility
# with FreeBSD and other operating systems that have no better

#
# Older versions also had an OSS compatibility wrapper on that USE so
# they are excluded.

# Mask usb USE flag for newest PCSC-Lite, since on Linux we want to
# use libudev instead.
