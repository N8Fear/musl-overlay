MUSL-Overlay
============

This is the "reboot" of my musl related ebuild repository.
Since upstream made a clean cut and isn't part of the old hardened-overlay
anymore, I will do a similar apporach here.
In contrast to the former version (that I'll keep archived in another branch)
I'll not include the contents of the official musl overlay but only ebuilds
fixed by me.
I generally plan on upstreaming them if time allows but if someone else wants
to do it: feel welcome. Just do it. Being credited as source of the ebuilds and
patches would be nice but isn't required.

LICENSE
-------

Since most of these ebuilds derrive from the upstream ones, which are IIRC
licensed under GPLv2 I consider these ebuilds the same.
The patches I made I'd also consider GPLv2 or whatever the upstream considers
compatible with their license.
