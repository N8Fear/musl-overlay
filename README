This overlay is based on the pieworld work done by former gentoo developer kevquinn and psm.
Changes by Xake and zorry.
Thanks KernelOfTruth, dw and everyone else helping testing, suggesting fixes and other things we have missed.
For questions there is a tread @ forums.gentoo.org
This overlay has support for PIE/PIC, -fstack-protector{,-all} and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0,1,2 via split minispecs for GCC-4.x
We have disable -fstrict-overflow flag.
-Wformat-security is on as default.
uClibc is not supported yet. you will need 0.9.0.30 when we support it.
If you want GCC 4.4 then use the testing branch.
You need a least glibc 2.8, grub and gcc from the overlay to make it work.
It may need to be unmasked or add as unstable.
Notice: pieworld.README is not up-to-date, it is mostly here for reference since it is the work we based this overlay on.
The working gcc 4.3.2-r2 in portage only have PIE/PIC support yet.
