This overlay is based on the pieworld work done by former gentoo developer kevquinn.
In fact it is his gcc-4.2 work but with version bumps on the ebuilds and eclasses updated to reflect changes from mainline portage and fix bugs in regadrs to hardened gcc-4.
For questions there is email or pm me over @ forums.gentoo.org

This overlay has support for -fPIE and -fstack-protector{,-all} for GCC-4.2.x.
I think I will add support for GCC-4.3.x when GCC-4.3.1 comes out.
Additional support for -DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and other options may be added later.
