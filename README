This overlay is for Hardened Development, this is where we can test hardened toolchain, bugfixes, packages, profiles and eclasses before
commiting to the tree.

Keep the entire overlay to that of gentoo policy, all functions of the overlay will work there way to the tree, once we reach a state
that is acceptable for use by the users.

For help on using and testing the overlay please refer to :
Forum tread http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-790110.html

Bugs should be filled on bugs.gentoo.org, please ensure that you make it clear that the bug is
caused or a part of the hardened-dev overlay, if you are unsure file an advanced bug report and 
assign to hardened-dev@gentoo.org and someone from dev team will reassign if needed; more 
The testing branch is if we need to do major change on this overlay.
