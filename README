This overlay is based on the pieworld work done by former gentoo developer kevquinn and psm.
Changes by Xake and zorry.
Thanks KernelOfTruth, dw and everyone else helping testing, suggesting fixes and other things we have missed.
For questions there is a tread @ forums.gentoo.org
This overlay has support for -fPIE, -fstack-protector{,-all} and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0,1,2 trough splitted minispecs for GCC-4.x
We have disable -fstrict-overflow flag.
uclibc is not supported yet.
if u want GCC 4.3 then use the testing branch
For /etc/portages/packages.* files read packages.README
Notice: pieworld.README is not up-to-date, it is mostly here for reference since it is the work we based this overlay on.
