This overlay is based on the pieworld work done by former gentoo developer kevquinn and psm.
Changes by Xake and zorry.
For questions there is thead @ forums.gentoo.org
This overlay has support for -fPIE, -fstack-protector{,-all} and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0,1,2 trough splitted minispecs for GCC-4.2.x.
We have disable -fstrict-overflow flag.
Support for GCC-4.3.x is in the testing branch.

Notice: pieworld.README is not up-to-date, it is mostly here for reference since it is the work we based this overlay on.
